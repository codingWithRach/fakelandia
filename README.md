# Justice for Fakelandia

## Introduction

The faraway country of Fakelandia has decided to modernise their justice system with a fancy new technology: "websites".

Fakelandia is a happy place with a low crime rate, but it's important to each citizen that justice is seen to be served, so they'd like a website to keep abreast of the latest justice developments - and they've specifically asked for YOU to help out.

## Crimes and Misdemeanours

The Fakelandians have asked for a site that lets them browse lists of crimes committed today, and also for functionality that helps citizens confess to their own crimes.

As a non-citizen, you might not be aware that there are only four possible crimes in Fakelandia:

- Mild Public Rudeness
- Speaking in a Lift
- Not Eating Your Vegetables
- Supporting Manchester United

Despite the clear severity of some of these awful crimes, the Fakelandians refer to them all as "misdemeanours".

The Fakelandians have provided an API for you to call to get a list of misdemeanours.

The Fakelandian system for getting random punishment inspiration is to use a service called Picsum, which can be accessed by putting a particular URL into an image tag.
